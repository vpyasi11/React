// Component lifecycle methods (Mounting/ updating/ unmounting)

** In react, two types of components - functional(using functions) and class components(to be deprecated)

# Mounting/ updating/ unmounting (lifecycle for functional components)

    > Mounting (Phase I): 
      - When component load for first browser paint
      - the jsx/html loads -> inserted into browser realDOM
      - Inner Phase -> componentwillmount
      - state or props (useState) will mount first 

    > Updating (Phase II):
      - when components updates
      - Inner Phase -> componentwillupdate

    > Unmounting (Phase III):
      - Component removed from browser
      - Inner Phase -> componentwillunmount
