// component lifecylce method;

What have leant till now?
==> in terms of hooks : useState and UseEffect 
==> states and props
==> react router dom and routing and linking
==>axios and api calling in UseEffect.
==> setting up states and mapping an Array in react.
==> rendering and making of components.

// In React , we have  two types of components :functional components and Class components.
// component lifecylce method : Class component

// component lifecylce method  : functional components
// component lifecylce method : mounting , updating and unmounting;

// mounting :phase 1: When your component load for the first browser paint ,
              whenever you create a component, you write jsx or html ,this html needs to be insereted or to loaded in browser real DOM.
   Inner phase of mounting :(componentwillmount) 
   : state or props or anything related to useState :
   : Using UseEffect without dependcy :empty dependcy array.

// updating :phase2 :When all the components and its member childs are mounted or already loaded on the bower realDOM , than if you want to something it comes in updating phase.
           Ex : dom manipulating using UseEffect, api calling 
    Inner phase of updating :(componentwillupdate) :UseEffect hook :dependcy Array :ex:vounter state we passed in the dependcy array;
    : when you provide state in dependcy array : based on this UseEffect will update the component.

     

// unmounting : when component is removed from browser realDom either way due to stoping of server or due to conditonal rendering.
   Inner phase of unmounting :(componentwillunmount)
   :UseEffect returns function which is known as a cleanup function, which in return can help you to clean any type of aftereffect which you have given to components.
   and the moment this is done , we are performing componentwillunmount inner phase action. 
   // useEffect(() => {
//   first

//   return () => {
//     second or cleanup function
//   }
// }, [third])
